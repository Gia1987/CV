I m a Full Stack Software Developer in training at Makers Academy. I have learned Ruby and JavaScript and how to build programs with those languages. I m able to work well alone as well as being an excellent team player. Good logical approach to problem solving, happy to help others if they ask for it.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving
  While working on the Acebook project, my team experienced some version control issues relating to database migration. Thanks to research ability, I managed to solve these issues and also share the solution to all team members.      

#### Fast Learner
  Several weeks at the coding bootcamp, Makers Academy tests this skill constantly whether it'd be a new framework or language. Expecially I remember when I built Thermostat in JavaScript in less than three days, I realised how much I have learned until that moment.

#### Working under Pressure
  Working as support worker often I had to deal with challenging or confrontational behavior and stressful situations. In these situations, I was  able to stay calm and handle the pressure easily.
  At Makers I experienced, expecially during team projects, how importat is to keep calm and concentration despite the deadlines to produce a good quality of code.
