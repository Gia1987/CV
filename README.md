## Skills

#### Problem Solving
  A good example of when I used my problem-solving skills in a specific situation could be during my Bootcamp in computer science at Makers Academy. I was working with my team to build a clone of Facebook in ruby on rails, and we were struggling with databases migration. No one knew how to overcome the issues faced and we got stuck on those for a while. I decided then to take the lead and started to perform a few researches online, along with consulting other colleagues outside my team and managed to find the answers we were looking for and go ahead successfully with the rest of the project. I shared with the rest of my team all the new findings I had got, along with the methodology that brought me there and my opinions on how to face a potential similar situation in the future.

#### Fast Learner
  Again, during my intensive Bootcamp, I had very little time to learn a considerable amount of content, and I was able to do this successfully with great feedback from both my teachers and colleagues. For instance, I remember when I built Thermostat, a week challenge, in JavaScript in less than three days. In that situation, I realized how much I had learnt until that moment and how quickly I was able to do that.

#### Perseverance, Patience and Passion:
  Perseverance and patience have played a significant role in my growth and learning process because they allowed me to complete my intensive Bootcamp course successfully. The Bootcamp in computer science at Makers Academy was an intensive course with a lot of knowledge to be learnt in a very short time. Lots of students find it very stressful as deadlines are tights and timings are very stretched, but I found it exciting and motivating and I think this was due to the passion, constancy and dedication that I put in it.
  Able to work under pressure and calm disposal:
  During my time working as a Support Worker, those were essential attitudes in order to provide excellent customer service to clients. I was able to keep calm despite very delicate situations when the clients were showing challenging behaviours.

#### Working under Pressure
  Working as support worker often I had to deal with challenging or confrontational behaviour and stressful situations. In these situations, I was  able to stay calm and handle the pressure easily.
  At Makers I experienced, especially during team projects, how important is to keep calm and concentration despite the deadlines to produce a good quality of code.
