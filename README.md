## Skills

#### Problem Solving
  A good example of when I used my problem-solving skills in a specific situation could be during my Bootcamp in computer science at Makers Academy. I was working with my team to build a clone of Facebook in ruby on rails, and we were struggling with databases migration. No one knew how to overcome the issues faced and we got stuck on those for a while. I decided then to take the lead and started to perform a few researches online, along with consulting other colleagues outside my team and managed to find the answers we were looking for and go ahead successfully with the rest of the project. I shared with the rest of my team all the new findings I had got, along with the methodology that brought me there and my opinions on how to face a potential similar situation in the future.

#### Fast Learner
  Several weeks at the coding bootcamp, Makers Academy tests this skill constantly whether it'd be a new framework or language. Especially I remember when I built Thermostat in JavaScript in less than three days, I realised how much I have learned until that moment.

#### Working under Pressure
  Working as support worker often I had to deal with challenging or confrontational behaviour and stressful situations. In these situations, I was  able to stay calm and handle the pressure easily.
  At Makers I experienced, especially during team projects, how important is to keep calm and concentration despite the deadlines to produce a good quality of code.
