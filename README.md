I think that technology brought a significant change to people’s lives and I want to give my contribute to carry on with this, improving and simplifying the quality of the society.
Working as a Developer would allow me to use my skills which I have been trained for and the talent I was born with and land them to the society. Indeed in my previous job as a Support Worker  I was able to exploit just partially the skills, I think I have.
I'm a Full Stack Software Developer who recently graduated from Makers Academy. I have learned Ruby and JavaScript and how to build programs with those languages. I'm able to work well alone as well as being an excellent team player. Good logical approach to problem solving, happy to help others if they ask for it.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving
  While working on the Acebook project, my team experienced some version control issues relating to database migration. Thanks to research ability, I managed to solve these issues and also share the solution to all team members.      

#### Fast Learner
  Several weeks at the coding bootcamp, Makers Academy tests this skill constantly whether it'd be a new framework or language. Especially I remember when I built Thermostat in JavaScript in less than three days, I realised how much I have learned until that moment.

#### Working under Pressure
  Working as support worker often I had to deal with challenging or confrontational behaviour and stressful situations. In these situations, I was  able to stay calm and handle the pressure easily.
  At Makers I experienced, especially during team projects, how important is to keep calm and concentration despite the deadlines to produce a good quality of code.
